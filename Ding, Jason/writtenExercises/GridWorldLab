set 7
1. act, getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, setMoveLocation, makeMove
2. getActors, processActors, getMoveLocation, selectmoveLocation, makeMove
3. No because the getActors class shouldn't be specific for every subclass.
4. color, direction, location
5. getLocation: returns location of the critter, getDirection returns the direction of the critter (N,S,E,W)
   makeMove moves the critter to the desired spot
6. because there is always a default constructor in the subclasses

set 8
1. the act method does not work for the ChameleonCritter but the class overrides the processActors and makeMove methods. 
   This creates a different behavior than usual without overriding.
2. because it uses the makeMove method of Critter and in order to do so it uses super.makeMove
3. make the makeMove method hold a value of the Critter's current position and if Critter makes a new move it will place a flower at the 
   position that it was previously held
4. it doesn't need to override the method becauseCritter already takes care of it so as long as ChameleonCritter does not change that it 
   will not need to override
5. actor and all its subclasses
6. by calling getGrid which is inherited from Actor

set 9 
1. there is no need to override because both methods are supposed to do the same thing
2. getActors method only looks for neighbors that are immediately in front of the crab critter and to its right-front and left-front locations
   these positions are the ones that get eaten
3. The method getLocationsInDirections uses this array to determine and return valid adjacent locations of this critter in the directions 
   given by the array parameter. 
4. (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) 
5. Similarities: They both randomly choose their next location from their list of possible move locations.
   Differences: A crab critter will only move to its left or its right. A critter’s possible move locations are any of its eight
   adjacent neighboring locations. When a critter cannot move, it does not turn, but crab critter does
6. If the parameter loc in makeMove is equal to the crab critter’s current location, it turns instead of moving
7. A crab critter inherits the processActors method from the Critter class. CrabCritter is a Critter, a crab critter will not eat any other
   critter.
