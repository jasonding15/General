/**
 * A WolfCritter has a 50% chance of eating a SheepCritter
 * immediately in front of it. A WolfCritter does not eat
 * any other actors and does not consider any other locations.
 * 
 * If a WolfCritter has eaten for 4 consecutive runs of act
 * (including the current run) it produces a new WolfCritter
 * immediately in front of it.
 * 
 * If a WolfCritter has not eaten for 10 consecutive runs of
 * act it dies (removes itself from the grid). If a WolfCritter
 * does not die it moves like a Critter.
