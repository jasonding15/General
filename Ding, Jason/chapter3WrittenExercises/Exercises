R3.1: There is a already a constructor that takes no parameters that defaults the initial balance at $0;

R3.2: BankAccount b = new BankAccount(5000) creates a new reference 'b' pointing towards the object 
	  BankAccount with $5000 in it.
	  BankAccount b only creates a reference called 'b'.
 
R3.3: new BankAccount(5000) creates a new object BankAccount. BankAccount b = new BankAccount(5000) creates
	  a new object BankAccount and a reference 'b' pointing to that object.
	  
R3.7: The this keyword is a reference to the current object. ie, if the instance fields are called the same 
	  thing as the constructor parameters, calling "this" would mean the instance field
	  
R3.11: a local variable exists solely within the method it is created/used in. A parameter variable 
	   is external. It is passed in to the method from the caller
	   
R3.12: a local variable exists solely within the method it is created in. An instance field exists througout
	   the entire class
